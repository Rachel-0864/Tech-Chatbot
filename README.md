# Tech-Chatbot
TECH Chatbot is a conversational assistant that integrates Ollama (local AI model) and DeepSeek (cloud-based AI) with a Gradio-powered frontend. It allows users to chat with an AI, choose their preferred backend (local or cloud), and view chat history all through a secure login-protected interface.
